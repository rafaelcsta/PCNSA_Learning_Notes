  Simultaneous traffic classification & enforcement
  Full-stack single-pass inspection

- Traffic Planes
  Palo Alto splits hardware resources between two traffic planes
- Control
  Configuration, logging, reporting
- Data
  Signature matching, security & network processing

# Management Options

- Web Interface
  Local - http ot https from local PC
  Centralized - Panorama

- CLI
  Console, SSH, Telnet

- API
  XML
  REST

- Management Port
  Special interface designed for administration
  Part of the Control Plane
- Data ports also support management functions
  Management Profiles
  Service Routes

# Service Routes

- Required to provide access to external services through data ports
  Device > Setup > Services > Service Route Configuration > Customize

# Firewall CLI

- Palo Alto firewalls use two CLI modes
  Operational - Basic networking/system commands & verification
  Configuration - Accessible via configure

- CLI Enhancements
  Use find to figure out the command syntax
  Use "?"
  Use the "Tab" key
  Use the "|" symbol along with match or except for output filtering
+ - command needs a value
* - this is required to run a command
> - more options to choose

# Configuration Files

- Running Configuration
  Current configuration enforced in the Data Plane
  Control the firewall's behavior
  Saved to running-config.xml

- Candidate Configuration
  Temporary configuration stored in the memory in the Control Plane
  Saved as either default snapshot.xml or as a custom XML file
  Requires a commit

- Revert to Last Saved Configuration
  Replaces current candidate configuration settings with a saved candidate configuration file
- Revert to Running Configuration
  Replaces current candidate configuration settings with the current running configuration
- Load
  Overwrites the current candidate configuration with a config file
- Export
  Exports a Current/Running Configuration file as an XML (backups)
- Import, Save

# Dynamic Updates

- Keep the system up-to-date with latest threats, applications & more

# General Configuration

- Device > Setup > Management
  Hostname
  Domain
  Login Banner

- Device > Setup > Operations
  SNMP

- Device > Setup > Services
  DNS
  NTP

# Admin Roles

- Define the type of access that an administrator has to the firewall
  Dynamic - based on pre-built profiles
  Role Based - Custoner access for granular control

- Configuration
  Device > Administrators
  Device > Admin Roles

# Data Interfaces

- PAN-OS supports several types of interfaces and can operate in multiple deployments
  Tap, Virtual Wire, Layer 2, Layer 3

- Tap
  Works on a copy of network traffic
  Port mirroring (SPAN)
  Deployed for logging & visibility

- Virtual Wire
  For inline deployments
  Traffic control, decryption, QoS, etc.
  A logical connection of two ports
  No L2/L3 addresses
  No management capabilities
  Easy to integrate
  Allows for subinterfaces
- Virtual Wire interfaces must be attached to a Virtual Wire Object
  Default Virtual Wire ports may need to be removed

- Layer 2
  Used for L2 switching
  Inline
  Require a VLAN Object
  Support subinterfaces

- Layer 3
  Used for L3 routing (IPv4, IPv6)
  Inline
  Require a Virtual Router
  Support subinterfaces & management

- Other interfcaes

- Loopback
  Virtual L3 ports internal to the firewall
  Used in many scenarios
  Routing, DNS sinkholes & more

- Tunnel
  Virtual interface used for VPN representation

# Virtual Router

- Enables routing functions
  Interfaces
  RIB - Control Plane
  FIB - Data Plane

- Supported Routing Technologies
  Static routes
  OSPF, OSPFv3, BGP, RIP
  PIM-SM, PIN-ASM, PIM-SSM, IGMP version 1/2/3

# Security Zones

- A group of interfaces representing a segment controlled by the firewall
  LAN1, Internet, etc.

- A firewall interface can belong to only one zone
  Interface type & zone type must match
  Zone-unassigned interface does not process traffic

- Zones affects the data traffic
  Intra-zone - allowed by default
  Inter-zone - Policy Rule to allow packets through

			### Palo Alto Firewall Policies ###
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Policies Overview

- Enforce rules & actions to safely enable applications
- Supported Policies
  Security
  NAT
  QoS
  Policy Based Forwarding
  Decryption
  Application Override
  Authentication
  DoS Protection
  Tunnel Inspection
  SD-WAN

# Policy Rules

- Polices are defined through Rules
  Common Criteria
  Conditions & Actions

- General Rule Processing
  Top-down until a match is found

# Security Policy Overview

- Primary traffic control mechanism
  Configured through Rules
    Attribute-based
      Source/Destination Zone, Addresses, Applications & more
    Top-down evaluation
      First-match processing logic
      Add specific rules first

# Security Policy Rules

- Rule Components
  Name
  Source/Destination Zone
  Rule Type: Intrazone, Interzone, Universal (Intra + Inter)
  Source/Destination Address
  User
  HIP Profile
  Application
  Service: Select, any, applicaton-default
  URL Category
  Profile Setting: Only for "Allow" rules
  Tag
  Other Settings: Description, Audit, Comment, Logging, QoS
  Action

- Action Types
  Allow
  Deny: Block traffic; Based on the application's default Deny Action
  Drop: Silently drops the application; Optionally sends ICMP Unreachable (used in UDP based applications)
  Reset: Client, Server, Both; Optionally sends ICMP Unreachable (used in UDP based applications)

- Default Rules
  The last two (pre-defined) rules of the Policy
  Intrazone-default
  Interzone-default
  Processed last: Only apply for traffic that does not match any user-defined rules

# Policy Objects

- Containers for representation of discrete data
- Object Types
  Address (Group)/Region
  User (Group)
  Application Group
  Application Filter
  Service (Group)

# Working with Security Policy

- Verification & Troubleshooting
  Device > Troubleshooting > Security Policy Match
  Rule Usage: Hit Count, Last hit, First hit
  Device > Setup > Management > Policy Rulebase Settings

# Verify routing table
  show routing route

# ICMP and ping

- ICMP application - all ICMP messages except echos (ping)
- ping application - ICMP echo

# NAT Policy

- Enforces packet translations through rules
  Source & destination zones (required), source/destination addresses, interface and more
- Rule Processing
  Top-down, first-match
  
# NAT & Security Policy

- IP Addresses
  NAT & Security Policy rules should always refer to the original IPs. i.e. pre-NAT
- Zones
  NAT Policy rules should refer to the orignal packet (pre-NAT)
  Securtity Policy rules
    Refer to the original packet for the source zone (pre-NAT)
    Refer to the translated packet for the destination zone (post-NAT)
    
- Find the right zone for an IP
  test routing fib-lookup

# Working with NAT

- Verification & Troubleshooting
  CLI: show session, show running ippool, show system state | match nat
  
# Syslog

- Syslog Configuration
  Server Profile: Device > Server Profiles > Syslog
  Log Forwarder: Object > Log Forwarding
  Policy update - with created profile
  System/Config Logs: Device > Log Settings

# App-ID

- Advanced traffic classification engine
  Not dependent on regular protocl/port criteria

- Identification Mechanisms
  Application Signatures
- Decryption (SSL/TLS, SSH)
- Application & Protocol Decoders
  Detect tunneled applications and look for protocol conformance
- Heuristics

# Application Database

- Stores informations about all knwon applications & their properties
  Objects > Applications

# Unknown Applications

- Unknown Application Handling
  Dedicated policy rule for unknown traffic
  App-ID request
  App-ID development

https://applipedia.paloaltonetworks.com/

# Application Dependencies

- PAN-OS correlates some applications with other(s)
  e.g. if App1 depends on App2m using App1 in a rules is not sufficient
  
- Implicit Dependencies
  Required dependent applications will be enabled automatically
  
- Explicit Dependencies
  Required dependent applications have to be added manuallu
  Rule "Applications" tab ("Depends On")
  
# Application Groups

- A collection of applications defined within a single object
  
# Application Filters

- Similar to Groups, but updated dynamically
  New applications matching the filter criteria will be added automatically
  Defined through application attributes: Category, Subcategory, Technology, Risk Factor, Characteristics
  
# Customer Applications

- Created for better visibility & granular control
  Stored in a separate databse
  Not affected by App-ID updates

# User-ID Overview

- User-ID allows to identify users and enable identiy-based access
  Granular per-user and/or per-group Security Policy rules
  
# User-ID Mappings

- User-ID works by mapping IP addresses to usernames
- Group Mappings
  The firewall can collect group mapping information for simplified administration
  LDAP servers only
- Most mapping techniques involves using a User-Id Agent
  Windows Agent
    External, installed on domain servers
    Saves CPU on the firewall's management plane
  Integrated Agent
    Built-in to the firewall
    Reduces bandwidth usage
    
# Mapping Methods

- Server Monitoring
  Analysis of security event logs (login events)
- Syslog
  Analysis of received Syslog messages (login/logout events)
- Port Mapping
  For multi-user systems, such as Microsoft Terminal Server or Citrix
- XFF Headers
  For proxy servers supporting X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header
- GlobalProtect
  For GlobalProtect VPN endpoints
- Authentication
  An active mapping mechanism
  Captive Portal authentication
  
# Captive Portal

- A special web portal used to capture user's credentials

# User-ID Configuration Overview

- User-ID configuration requires multiple steps
  Enable the engine for the right zone(s)
  Map IP addresses to users
  Create identity-based rule

# Configuration - AD Integration

- LDAP Profile
  Device > Server Profiles > LDAP
  BIND DN must include the domain name
- Group Mappings
  Device > User Identification > Group Mapping Settings
  Verify LDAP connectivity under "Group Include List"
  Verify with show user group name [list]

# Configuration - Captive Portal

- Captive interface
  Management Profile (Network > Network Profiles > Interface Management)
    Response Pages, User-ID
  Service Routes (Device > Setup > Services)
    LDAP, UID Agent
- Authentication Profile(s)
  Device > Authentication Profile
    Type, User Domain, Server Profile, Allow List
  Verify with test authentication
- Portal Certificate
  Device > Certificate Management > Certificates > Device Certificates > Generate
    For self-signed make sure to chek "Certificate Authority"
  Bind certificate to a SSL/TLS Service Profile
    Device > Certificate Management > SSl/TLS Service Profile
- Captive Portal
  Device > User Identification > Captive Portal Settings
    Authentication & SSL/TLS Profiles, Mode, Redirect Host
    
# Configuration - User-ID & Authentication

- User-ID
  Network > Zones
    Enable User Identification
    Trusted zones only
- Authentication Policy
  Policies > Authentication
    Set users to "unknown"
    Set action to "web-form"
    
# Configuration - Remaining Steps
- Security Policy
  Add identity-based rules "User"
- Verification
  Monitor > Traffic
  Monitor > User-ID
  show user ip-user-mapping
  
- Authentication Policy is processed before Security Policy

# Security Profiles Overview

- An additional set of inspection engines available to scan traffic
  Configured under Objects > Security Profiles
  Activated within a Security Policy "allow" rule"
    Actions > Profile Settings

# Wildfire Analysis

- Forwards unknown files for WildFire analysis
  Public, Private or Hybrid

# Security Profile Groups

- Logical "containers" for storing multiple Security Profiles
  Simplify policy configuration
  
- Default Security Profile Group
  A group named "default"

# Zone Protection Overview

- Defends the entire ingress zone against different types of attacks
  Offers broad protection - not designed to protect a specific host
  
- Zone Protection applies to new sessions only
  Existing connections bypass Protection Profiles
  The zone is determined from the ingress interface
  
# Configuring Zone Protection

- Create and apply protection profile
  Network > Network Profiles > Zone Protection
  Network > Zones > Zone Protection Profile
  Verify with CLI show zone-protection
  
# DoS Protection Overview

- Protects network against floods & resource-based attacks
  Similar to Zone Protection, but more granular
  Processed before Security Policy
  Enforced on new sessions only
  Resource-intensive
  
# Protection Profiles

- DoS Protection rule logic depends on the configured Profile
  Aggregate vs Classified
  Aggregate Profile applies to the combined traffic (per device group)
  Classified Profile applies to individual devices (per device)
- Profiles can be combined per rule

# Configuring DoS Protection

- Protection Profiles: Objects > Security Profiles > DoS Protection
- Protection Rules: Policies > DoS Protection
